# Status

The software has no official release yet. The software has experimental support for CMDI v1.2.

NaLiDa2Marc exploits context-specific information from SfS-based CMDI profiles to minimize information loss.
For a general transformation from CMDI to MARC-21 (with more information loss), please consult Cmdi2Marc.
